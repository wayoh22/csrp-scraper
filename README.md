# CSRP Webscraper

---

This is a webscraper I built for those that use CSRP.net to be assigned to officiate soccer games. Instead of manually having to login and type everything out into an excel file, I wrote a script that will do just that. 

Future Goals: 
    1. Clean up excel export look
    2. Include fee amounts
    3. Make a function to check and remove duplicates after multiple exports
